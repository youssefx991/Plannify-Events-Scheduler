# Plannify-Events-Scheduler
# This is an application to schedule the events for multiple users. (each user has an account to deal with his events ).
## Each event must have:
1. A name
2. A start date
3. An end date
4. A place
5. Event’s start time
6. Reminder time … etc
7. Done (Yes/No)
## The user must be able to:
1. log in (sign up if he/she hasn't an account).
2. Add,
3. Delete an event
4. Update an event.
5. Display all events
## The application should refuse to add an event that intersects with
another event.
## The user can display his events sorted by start date and/or reminder time.
## When an event is done it should
1. disappear from the upcoming events
2. be added in another data structure holding only the done events.
